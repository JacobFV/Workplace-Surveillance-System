# Workplace Surveillance System

When you need to catch employees on their phone, this will do the trick! I copied this application from a [codelabs tutorial](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflowjs-teachablemachine-codelab/) as I was first learning tensorflow. The demonstration to my employer succeeded identifying employees on their phone, but he was not willing to pay a monthly to use it.
